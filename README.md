# Experiment-2
Aim:To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

Theory: A C++ program follows a basic structure that includes:

Header files (#include <iostream>) for input/output

Main function (int main()) where execution starts

Statements inside the main block

Return statement to end the program

C++ supports different data types to store different kinds of values:

Data Type	Example	Purpose

int	10	For whole numbers

float	3.14	For decimal numbers

char	'A'	For single characters

bool	true	For true/false values

string	"Hello"	For text *(needs <string>)

These are used to declare variables that store input, perform calculations, and display output.
